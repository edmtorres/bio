As a PhD student, my research focuses on the evolution of the mitochondrial genome in relation to the nuclear genome. In my thesis, I explore three key areas of evolutionary mitochondrial genomics: (1) intraspecies variation in humans, (2) interspecies variation among great apes, and (3) mutational processes across diverse mammalian species.

Mitochondria are essential organelles responsible for cellular energy production and regulation of apoptosis. Their optimal function relies on on coordination with the nuclear genome, which encodes most mitochondrial proteins. To maintain efficiency, the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes must coevolve to counterbalance the high mutation rate in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). 

A discordance between genomes leading to incompatibility has been rarely tested in human populations despite evidence in other species. Notably, mtDNA variations, including insertions and deletions (indels), are frequently associated with Mendelian disease and complex traits. However, mtDNA indels remain undercharacterized in both somatic and germline tissues at a de novo mutation scale. 

Additionally, segments of mtDNA can integrate into the nuclear genome, creating nuclear sequences of mitochondrial origin, known as NUMTs. These NUMTs were instrumental in the endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria, facilitating the transfer of genes to the nuclear genome and establishing interdependence and coevolution. NUMTs have continued to integrate and expand within the nuclear genome, acting as evolutionary markers similar to transposable elements.

 In my thesis work, I present three projects in evolutionary mitochondrial genomics, focusing on (1) intraspecies variation in humans, (2) interspecies variation among great apes, and (3) mutational processes across distant mammals.
