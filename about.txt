Welcome! My name is Edmundo Torres-González, and I am a PhD student in Bioinformatics and Genomics at the Makova Lab, Pennsylvania State University. My research explores the complexities of genomic data through an evolutionary genomics lens, focusing on humans and non-human primates.

Originally from Puerto Rico, I earned a B.S. in Biology at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez, where I concentrated on human population genetics, particularly in admixed populations. I further expanded my expertise during a postbaccalaureate fellowship at the NIH National Cancer Institute, where I developed a strong foundation in cancer epidemiology and genetics, with a focus on underserved Hispanic populations.
