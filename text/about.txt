As a PhD student, my research focuses on the evolution of the mitochondrial genome in relation to the nuclear genome. In my thesis, I explore three key areas of evolutionary mitochondrial genomics: (1) intraspecies variation in humans, (2) interspecies variation among great apes, and (3) mutational processes across diverse mammalian species.
