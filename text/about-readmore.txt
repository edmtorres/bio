Originally from Puerto Rico, I earned a B.S. in Biology at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez, where I concentrated on human population genetics, particularly in admixed populations. I further expanded my expertise during a postbaccalaureate fellowship at the NIH National Cancer Institute, where I developed a strong foundation in cancer epidemiology and genetics, with a focus on underserved Hispanic populations.

I am excited to share that I will soon be joining the University of Minnesota Twin Cities as a postdoctoral researcher, working alongside Drs. María Nieves-Colón and Arslan Zaidi.

Feel free to explore this portfolio to learn more about my academic background, research projects, and professional journey.
