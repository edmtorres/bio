I'm Edmundo Torres-Gonz√°lez, a PhD student in Bioinformatics and Genomics at the Makova Lab. I specialize in analyzing genomic data to uncover insights into evolutionary processes and genomic features like Nuclear sequences of Mitochondrial DNA origin (NUMTs). With a passion for computational biology and data-driven research, I apply bioinformatics tools and statistical analysis to solve complex biological problems. My work spans various areas, including sequence alignment, evolutionary genomics, and data visualization.

I enjoy collaborating with fellow researchers, exploring new technologies, and sharing knowledge within the scientific community. Feel free to explore my work and contact me for collaboration or discussion!
